Configure and Verify Single-Area OSPF
This activity will guide you through the configuration and verification of OSPF for IPv4 on a Cisco IOS router. The lab is prepared with the devices that are represented in the topology diagram and the connectivity table. All devices have their basic configurations in place, including hostnames and IPv4 addresses. R2 and R3 are also configured with OSPF. You will configure OSPF on R1 and verify the results.

    "description": "You can configure basic OSPF in two steps:\n\nInstead of identifying networks, you can alternatively enable OSPF on an interface.\n\nThe `router ospf` command uses a process identifier as an argument. The process ID is a unique, arbitrary number that you select to identify the routing process. The process ID is locally significant and does not need to match the OSPF process ID on other OSPF routers. However, best practice suggests that the process ID should be the same on all routers in the same routing domain.\n\nThe `network` command identifies which IPv4 networks on the router are part of the OSPF network. For each network, you must also identify the OSPF area to which the networks belong. The network that is identified in the `network` command does not tell the router which network to advertise; instead, it indicates the interfaces on which OSPF will be enabled. Then, the network configured on these interfaces will be advertised into OSPF.\n\nAs with subnet mask and an IPv4 address, a wildcard mask is a string of 32 binary digits. However, a wildcard mask is used by a device to determine which bits of the address to examine for a match. A wildcard mask is not used on its own. It is used with an IPv4 address. The matching rule consists of a reference IPv4 address and a wildcard mask that applies to it. When a wildcard mask is applied to the reference IPv4 address, the result is the matching pattern of binary digits. For a match to occur, the IPv4 address from the packet header must match the resulting pattern.\n\nThe wildcard mask bits are used as follows:\n\n- Where wildcard mask bit is 0: the value found at the same position in the reference IPv4 address must be matched.\n\n- Where wildcard mask bit is 1: the value found at the same position in the reference IPv4 address can be ignored.\n\nComplete the following steps:",
