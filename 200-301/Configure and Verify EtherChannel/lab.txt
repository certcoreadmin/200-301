The purpose of this activity is to provide you with some experience working with EtherChannel. The live virtual lab is prepared with the switches represented in the topology diagram and the connectivity table. All devices have their basic configurations in place, including hostnames and IPv4 addresses. Note that all the links between the switches use pairs of connections. You will see that this fact does not lead to doubling of the bandwidth by default. You will configure EtherChannel on some of the links, examine how link aggregation affects STP topology for one of the VLANs, and verify the EtherChannel configuration.

The VLAN0010 ‘title’ indicates that you are seeing STP information only for VLAN 10, which is named VLAN0010.\n\nThe first part of the output provides two blocks of similar information. The first block gives information about the root switch and the second block gives information about the switch you are administering. The STP information for the root switch provides the STP priority and MAC address, the STP cost to the root switch, root port identifier (on your switch), and  the STP timers. When the switch you are administering is the root switch, in place of the cost and port identifier, you will see the phrase T**his bridge is the root**. As you can see from the output, SW1 is not the root switch.\n\nThe second block of information provides STP priority and MAC address, STP timers, and aging time for the switch you are administering.\n\nThe second part of the output is the table showing interface STP information, in particular STP role, STP status, STP cost, STP interface priority, and STP type, for all interfaces that are part of the VLAN that you specified in the command.\n\nBoth Eternet0/2 and 0/3 connect to SW3, but only Ethernet0/2 is forwarding traffic. The STP is blocking Ethernet0/3 to prevent a loop. Only half of the potential bandwidth in this pair of links is in use. Ethernet 0/0 and Ethernet 0/1 interfaces are both in the blocking state. They are not forwarding traffic. All interfaces have STP cost of 100.\n\nTo determine the resulting STP topology for VLAN 10, you need to examine the STP information on other switches also.\n\nTo identify the root switch in the topology, follow the direction in which the Root  port is facing. In this case, the Root port is Etherent0/2 facing toward SW3. On SW3, enter the `show spanning-tree vlan` 10 command.\n\nNotice the previously mentioned **This bridge is the root** message—you have discovered the root switch. Also notice that none of the interfaces have the Root role, they are all designated ports, which is another indicator that you have discovered the root switch.\n\nAfter you examine STP information for VLAN 10 on all the switches, the resulting topology should look like the one in the following figure.\n\nAlso, examine the STP configuration for other VLANs and determine the STP topology for VLAN 20 and VLAN 1. For your reference, these two STP topologies are also shown below."

    "instructions": "Examine the topology. Switches are interconnected with multiple trunk connections. There are many physical loops in the topology. To understand what the topology is, after the STP performs its processing, you need to examine the STP information on the switches. You need to establish what the resulting topology is for each VLAN after STP calculations. To begin, display the spanning tree information for VLAN 10 on SW1. To view STP information, use the `show spanning-tree` command. To view STP information for a specific VLAN, use the `show spanning-tree vlan` `vlan-id` command with the appropriate VLAN identifier. Display the spanning tree information for VLAN 10 on the other switches to complete your understanding of the VLAN 10 topology. Then examine the STP configuration for VLANs 20 and 1, to determine the STP topology for these VLANs.",

If so, repeat the command until all interfaces are in the forwarding state. The cost of the port channel is 56, which is much lower than the cost of 100, assigned to individual interfaces.\n\nThe MAC addresses might differ in your output.\n\nEthernet0/2 and 0/3 are no longer visible to the spanning tree. Instead, they have been replaced by the logical port channel 1 interface. The port channel is in the forwarding state. The forwarding state implies that the port channel is forwarding on all member interfaces. The cost of the port channel is 56, which is much lower than the cost of 100, assigned to individual interfaces. The following figure shows the STP topology for VLAN 10, after the link aggregation.\n\nThe Ethernet0/0 and Ethernet 0/1 are not in the blocking state any more. They are now forwarding. These interfaces connect to SW4. Since the path from SW1 back to the root (SW3) now costs less due to the port channel establishment, its ports have been selected as the designated ports for these two links. However, the ports on SW4 side of the links are now in the blocking state, which you can verify by issuing the `show spanning-tree vlan 10` command on SW4:\n\nNote that aggregating links does not affect STP root switch selection. The root selection is based on the switch STP priority and its MAC address."
