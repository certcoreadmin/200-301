This lab exercise will guide you through routing between VLANs. The devices are configured as shown in the topology diagram. Currently, devices have IPv4 addresses in the 10.10.1.0/24 or 10.10.2.0/24 subnets. You will start by migrating this configuration to one that uses two VLANs and two physical interfaces on R1 to route between them. You will then continue the migration to implement three VLANs and the use of trunking on R1 to allow one physical interface to have a logical presence on multiple VLANs. In the end, the switches will maintain their IP presence on VLAN 1, PC2 and PC4 will be on VLAN 2, and PC1 and PC3 will move to VLAN 3. R1 will be the default gateway for all hosts, and it will route between the VLANs. The SW1-SW2 link is configured as a trunk, and R1 E0/0 already has IPv4 address.
